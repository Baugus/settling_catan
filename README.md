# settling_catan
An exploration of odds and strategies in Settlers of Catan.

## hypothesis
There are games in which choosing a strategy with a lower average expected points but larger standard deviations/tails (particularly in the positive/upside direction) may be a more effective strategy for being competative (win rate) than a strategy that "plays the odds" and has a better expected average payout but less frequent outliers.
